# Arco

Arco is a voice-activated assistant, designed for Linux based systems.

Think of it as a Google Assistant knockoff. Just say "Hey Arco" and your wildest dreams become a reality. Arco is built in Python and leverages several libraries to help you control your system with voice commands. Launch applications, run scripts, modify files, and more.
